## Task 1
We are going to push changes to the search infrastructure, the functionality
should stay the same. In order to ensure we have delivered quality,
reliable and stable software what approach should we take?
1. Add a TEST-APPROACH.md explaining your test approach for this task,
   including different levels & types of test


My approach for this task is:

1. I do exploratory testing to become familiar with the application/search feature
2. I read the software project documentation to understand the exact requirements.
3. I evaluate the User stories for this feature with team members.
4. I write test cases for each User story based on the acceptance criteria.
5. I utilised techniques of Equivalent partitioning (Valid/Invalid Data, verify with alphanumeric characters, special, minimum, maximum, etc.), Use case testing, etc.
6. I execute the test cases with the test management tool.
7. I would manually make those test cases then I create test automation scripts after the test pass
   I add these test cases to the regression test set. If there is any bug, I create a bug ticket
   Once bugs are fixed, execute the failing test cases again to verify they pass.
   If this is the crucial part of the application, add it also to the smoke test 

Task 2
Fix the broken test /Done
Add a negative scenario /Done
